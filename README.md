<h1 align="center">Social Media Database</h1>

<ul>
<li>Through this project  we are creating a basic structure of a social media database that could easily be connected to a frontend interface.  </li>
<li>Here we are managing the data of multiple users, their followers, interests, and public activity on the social media platform which includes post likes, comments, comment likes, hashtag followed, bookmarks, and many more... </li>
<li>Through our SQL query we have shown a clear-cut description of the connection and interrelation between different activities on social media. </li>
<li>Here we have  tried to fetch and store the  data in its true storage form into this database like (img/videos in URL) </li>
<li>With our true efforts and research  we have tried to give a simple and more exact view of a basic social interconnecting site.</li>
</ul>
